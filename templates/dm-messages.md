# DM Message Templates — Design Arbitrage

## Template A: "Friendly Compliment + Offer" (Best Performer)

```
Hey [NAME]! 👋

Saw your post in [GROUP NAME] — looks like you do great [TRADE] work! I actually do business card and brand design for contractors here in Tennessee.

I took a few minutes and mocked up what a refreshed version of your card could look like (totally free, no strings attached). Thought you might like to see it:

[ATTACH WATERMARKED PREVIEW IMAGE]

If you want the full print-ready files, it's just $50 and I can have them to you today. Includes 3 different design options + unlimited tweaks until you love it.

Either way, keep crushing it! 💪
```

**Why it works:** Leads with value, not a sales pitch. The free preview is the hook.

## Template B: "Social Proof" (For skeptics)

```
Hey [NAME]! Quick question — would you be open to a free business card mockup?

I've been redesigning cards for contractors around [CITY] and the feedback has been awesome. Most guys tell me they get way more callbacks when their card looks professional.

Here's what I put together based on your current card:

[ATTACH WATERMARKED PREVIEW IMAGE]

$50 for the full package — 3 designs, print-ready files, and I handle revisions until it's perfect. Most of my clients order through Vistaprint after and have new cards in hand within a week.

Interested?
```

## Template C: "Problem → Solution" (Direct approach)

```
Hey [NAME] 👋

No offense intended at all — but I think your business card might be costing you jobs. I see a lot of contractors with great work but cards that don't match their quality.

I redesigned it real quick to show you what I mean:

[ATTACH WATERMARKED PREVIEW IMAGE]

Night and day difference, right? Full package is $50 — you get 3 options and print-ready files.

Want me to send the full designs over?
```

**⚠️ Use sparingly** — more direct, higher risk of offense but also higher conversion when it lands.

## Template D: "Referral Group Reply" (When someone posts their card in a referral thread)

```
[Reply to the thread, not DM]

Great recommendation! [CONTRACTOR NAME] does solid work.

[CONTRACTOR NAME] — if you ever want a refreshed version of your card, I do $50 redesigns for local contractors. Happy to mock one up for free if you're interested! Just shoot me a DM.
```

**Then when they DM:**
```
Hey! Thanks for reaching out. Here's what I put together:

[ATTACH WATERMARKED PREVIEW IMAGE]

I made 3 different versions. If you want the full print-ready files, it's $50 and I'll send them right over. I also do one round of revisions for free.

Here's the payment link: [STRIPE LINK]

Or if you want to see the other options first, just let me know!
```

## Follow-Up Templates

### Follow-Up #1 (48 hours after first DM, no response)
```
Hey [NAME]! Just following up on that card mockup I sent over. Did you get a chance to look at it?

No pressure at all — just wanted to make sure it didn't get buried in your messages. Happy to answer any questions!
```

### Follow-Up #2 (1 week after, no response)
```
Hey [NAME]! Last message from me, I promise 😄

That card redesign offer is still good whenever you're ready. $50 for the full package. Just let me know!
```

### Post-Purchase Follow-Up (1 week after delivery)
```
Hey [NAME]! How are the new cards working out? Get them printed yet?

Quick favor — if you know any other contractors who could use a card refresh, I'd love a referral. I'll do your next project at half off as a thank you! 🙏
