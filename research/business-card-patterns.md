## Scoring System

Rate each card 1-10 on:
- **Readability** (can you read it at arm's length?)
- **Professionalism** (would you trust this person in your home?)
- **Memorability** (does it stand out from others?)
- **Information** (does it have what's needed, nothing more?)

Cards scoring < 5 average = prime targets
